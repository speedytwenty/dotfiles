# dotfiles

"My" dotfilesâ€”presently used w/MacOSX with aspirations toward Ubuntu Budgie.

**Highlights:**

* Multi-terminal w/unified UX<br>
* Dual Shell (fish & zsh) with unified prompt (using superthingy)

## Utilities

### Markdown Preview

There are two targeted methods for previewing markdown:
* In-terminal preview
* Browser preview (restoring soon)

# In-Terminal Markdown Preview

A method for previewing formatted markdown while editing it.

Presently using `entr` and `glow`. Not sure I've got the paging right.


Run: `mdp [FILENAME.md]` to **[pre]view** a markdown file.
Run: `mdw [FILENAME.md]` to **watch** a markdown file, updating with each change.

## Shell

### ZSH


|    MOD      | TARGET | Label               | Description 
|:-----------:|:------:|:--------------------|:--------------------------------|
|   CTRL      |   Y    | Copy prompt    | Copy current command in prompt to system clipboard

## Terminals

Presently, I don't utilize tabs and am still building toward tmux... so I probably
don't _really_ know what I'm doing._

### Terminal Keybindings

Notable keybindings are intended for all included terminals.

The current source of truth can be found in the
[wezterm config](./config/wezterm/wezterm.lua).
